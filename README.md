# Aikido Code Coverage GitHub Action

Collect an [LCOV](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov) code coverage report produced by your
test suite and upload it to [Aikido](https://www.aikido.dev/).

The action reads one or more LCOV reports from the paths you provide. When multiple reports are
given, it merges them into a single file before upload. It then POSTs the LCOV content to the Aikido CI code coverage API together with the
repository name, commit SHA, and branch name.

Authentication uses GitHub OIDC (keyless). The job that runs this action must grant
`id-token: write`. No API token or repository secret is required.

## Usage

Run your tests with coverage first, then point this action at the generated LCOV file.

Example YAML file:

```yaml
name: Tests

on: push

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20

      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test -- --coverage # produces coverage/lcov.info

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: coverage
          path: coverage/

  upload-coverage:
    needs: test
    if: github.event_name == 'push'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write # required for upload
      contents: read # required for upload
    steps:
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: coverage
          path: coverage

      - name: Upload coverage to Aikido
        uses: AikidoSec/code-coverage-github-action@v1.1.0
        with:
          lcov-file-paths: coverage/lcov.info
```

### Uploading multiple reports

Provide more than one path when separate packages or CI shards each emit their own `lcov.info`. The
action merges all inputs into one upload.

```yaml
- name: Upload coverage to Aikido
  uses: AikidoSec/code-coverage-github-action@v1.1.0
  with:
    lcov-file-paths: |
      packages/a/coverage/lcov.info
      packages/b/coverage/lcov.info
```

### Monorepo with matrix jobs

When each package runs in its own job, LCOV files live on separate runners. Use
[`actions/upload-artifact`](https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact) and
[`actions/download-artifact`](https://github.com/actions/download-artifact) to collect
reports in a final job, then upload once to Aikido.

Upload from every test job separately would send partial coverage and can race — always
merge into a single upload per commit.

Example YAML file:

```yaml
name: Tests

on: push

jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        package: [packages/a, packages/b, packages/c]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20

      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test --workspace=${{ matrix.package }} -- --coverage

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: coverage-${{ matrix.package }}
          path: ${{ matrix.package }}/coverage/lcov.info

  upload-coverage:
    needs: test
    if: github.event_name == 'push'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          path: coverage-reports
          pattern: coverage-*
          merge-multiple: true

      - name: Upload coverage to Aikido
        uses: AikidoSec/code-coverage-github-action@v1.1.0
        with:
          lcov-file-paths: |
            coverage-reports/packages/a/coverage/lcov.info
            coverage-reports/packages/b/coverage/lcov.info
            coverage-reports/packages/c/coverage/lcov.info
```

`merge-multiple: true` extracts every matched artifact into one directory while preserving
each file's path, so the paths above match what `upload-artifact` stored. Adjust the matrix
and paths to match your repository layout.

Grant `id-token: write` on the job that runs this action (`upload-coverage` above), not on
the matrix test jobs.

## Inputs

| Input             | Required | Default | Description                                                                           |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `lcov-file-paths` | yes      | —       | Path(s) to the LCOV report file(s).                                                   |
| `region`          | no       | `eu`    | Aikido region for upload and OIDC audience: `eu`, `us`, `au`, or `us-gov`.            |
| `fail-on-error`   | no       | `true`  | Fail the action if reading or upload fails. Set to `false` to emit a warning instead. |

### Region

Set `region` to match your Aikido workspace. The value selects both the API host and the OIDC
token audience.

```yaml
- name: Upload coverage to Aikido
  uses: AikidoSec/code-coverage-github-action@v1.1.0
  with:
    lcov-file-paths: coverage/lcov.info
    region: us
```

## Authentication

The action authenticates with GitHub OIDC. The workflow job must grant `id-token: write`
so GitHub can mint a JWT for Aikido. Setting any `permissions` key resets the rest to
none, so also grant `contents: read` if the job checks out the repository.

```yaml
on: push

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npm test -- --coverage

      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: coverage
          path: coverage/

  upload-coverage:
    needs: test
    if: github.event_name == 'push'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write # required for upload
      contents: read # required for upload
    steps:
      - uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: coverage
          path: coverage

      - name: Upload coverage to Aikido
        uses: AikidoSec/code-coverage-github-action@v1.1.0
        with:
          lcov-file-paths: coverage/lcov.info
```
